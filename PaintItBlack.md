# Paint It Black Lyrics

## Original Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
I see a red door and I want it painted black  
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black  
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes  

[Chorus]  
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black  
With flowers and my love, both never to come back  
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away  
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day  

[Verse 2]  
I look inside myself and see my heart is black  
I see my red door, I must have it painted black  
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts  
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black  

[Chorus]  
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue  
I could not foresee this thing happening to you  
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun  
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes  
  
[Bridge]  
I wanna see it painted, painted black  
Black as night, black as coal  
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black  
Yeah!  
  
[Verse 3]  
I wanna see the sun, blotted out from the sky  
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black  
Yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black  
Black as night, black as coal  
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black  
Yeah!  
  
[Outro]  
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun  
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes  

## Alternate Lyrics

My version, but based on the first option made by ChatGPT.

I'm struggling with the second chorus...

[Verse 1]  
I see a desktop and I want it to be dark  
No brightness anymore, let's make it all go dark  
I see the icons glow, they're burnin' my poor eyes  
I have to squint so hard until the light theme goes  

[Chorus]  
I see the windows show and they are all dark-themed  
With menus and buttons, no color to attract  
I see people blinkin' and quickly turn away  
Like vampires in the sun, they hide behind the shade  

[Verse 2]  
I look at my browser, the light mode's such a pain  
I see the toggle button, I must make it dark  
Maybe then I'll browse with ease and not have to cut and paste  
It's not easy using Word to read all of the text  

[Chorus]  
No longer will my screen glow, turning light to dark  
I couldn't foresee the pics all with light backgrounds  
If we make it dark enough for the nightly search  
I might find the damn post before the mornin' comes  

[Bridge]  
I wanna make it, make it, make it dark  
Dark as night, dark as space  
I wanna make it, make it, make it, make it dark  
Yeah!  

[Verse 3]  
I wanna see the light, blotted out from the screen  
I wanna make it, make it, make it, make it dark  
Yeah!

[Chorus]  
I wanna make it, make it, make it, make it dark  
Dark as night, dark as space  
I wanna make it, make it, make it, make it dark  
Yeah!

[Outro]  
If we make it dark enough for the nightly search  
I might find the damn post before the mornin' comes
