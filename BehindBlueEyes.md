# Behind Blue Eyes

## Original Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes  
And no one knows what it's like  
To be hated  
To be fated  
To telling only lies  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But my dreams, they aren't as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
I have hours, only lonely  
My love is vengeance  
That's never free  
  
[Chorus]  
No one knows what it's like  
To feel these feelings  
Like I do  
And I blame you  
No one bites back as hard  
On their anger  
None of my pain and woe  
Can show through  
  
[Verse 2]  
But my dreams, they aren't as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
I have hours, only lonely  
My love is vengeance  
That's never free  
  
[Chorus]  
No one knows what it's like  
To feel these feelings  
Like I do  
And I blame you  
No one bites back as hard  
On their anger  
None of my pain and woe  
Can show through  
  
[Bridge]  
Discover l, mad man  
Bury my anger  
Bury my laughter  
Bury my laughter  
How does it feel?  
How does it feel?  
To be without a home  
Like a complete unknown  
Like a rolling stone  
  
[Outro]  
Ah, ah, ah  
No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes

[Verse 1]  
No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad app  
To be the sad chap  
Behind blue screen  
And no one knows what it's like  
To be outdated  
To be frustrated  
With endless routine  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But my code, it isn't flawless  
As my logic seems to be  
I have bugs, only solace  
My love is coding  
That's never free  
  
[Chorus]  
No one knows what it's like  
To debug my life  
Day and night  
And I blame you  
No one crashes back as hard  
On their keyboard  
None of my files and code  
Can break through  
  
[Verse 2]  
But my code, it isn't flawless  
As my logic seems to be  
I have lines, only endless  
My love is coding  
That's never free  
  
[Chorus]  
No one knows what it's like  
To code with passion  
Like I do  
And I blame you  
No one glitches back as hard  
On their circuit  
None of my bytes and scripts  
Can breakthrough  
  
[Bridge]  
Discover, I'm a nerd  
Hiding my laughter  
Behind my master  
Behind my master  
How does it compute?  
How does it compute?  
To be without Wi-Fi  
Like a disconnected guy  
Like a USB drive  
  
[Outro]  
Ah, ah, ah  
No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad app  
To be the sad chap  
Behind blue screen
