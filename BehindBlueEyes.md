# Behind Blue Eyes

## Original Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes  
And no one knows what it's like  
To be hated  
To be fated  
To telling only lies  
  
[Chorus]  
But my dreams, they aren't as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
I have hours, only lonely  
My love is vengeance that's never free  
  
[Verse 2]  
No one knows what it's like  
To feel these feelings  
Like I do  
And I blame you  
No one bites back as hard  
On their anger  
None of my pain and woe  
Can show through  

[Chorus]  
But my dreams, they aren't as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
I have hours, only lonely  
My love is vengeance that's never free  
  
[Bridge]  
Discover  
L-I-M-P, say it, discover  
L-I-M-P, say it, discover  
L-I-M-P, say it, discover  
L-I-M-P, say it, discover  
  
[Verse 3]  
No one knows what it's like  
To be mistreated  
To be defeated  
Behind blue eyes  
And no one knows how to say  
That they're sorry  
And don't worry  
I'm not tellin' lies  
  
[Chorus]  
But my dreams, they aren't as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
I have hours, only lonely  
My love is vengeance that's never free  

[Outro]  
No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes

[Verse1]  
No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad app  
To be the sad app  
Behind blue screen  
And no one knows what it's like  
To be hated  
To be dated  
To produce only logs
  
[Chorus]  
But my code, it's not as flawless  
As my logic seems to be  
I have bugs, only solace  
My love is coding that's never free  
  
[Verse2]  
No one knows what it's like  
To debug errors  
Like I do  
And I blame you  
No one hits back as hard  
On their PRs  
None of my code or hacks  
Can get through  
  
[Chorus]  
But my code, it's not as flawless  
As my logic seems to be  
I have bugs, only solace  
My love is coding that's never free  
  
[Bridge]  
Discover  
L-I-M-P, say it, discover  
L-I-M-P, say it, discover  
L-I-M-P, say it, discover  
L-I-M-P, say it, discover  

[Verse3]  
No one knows what it's like  
To be installed  
To be corrupted  
Behind blue screen  
And no one knows how to say  
That they're sorry  
And don't worry  
I have more backups
  
[Chorus]  
But my code, it's not as flawless  
As my logic seems to be  
I have bugs, only solace  
My love is coding that's never free  

[Outro]  
No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad app  
To be the sad app  
Behind blue screen
