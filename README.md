# Dylan-Beattie-and-the-Linebreakers

A small repo with potential songs for the Linebreakers to use. That is if they want to. These are here for a laugh, not to force them to perform them.

I had help from ChatGPT, but it was a bit off with the syllable count and rhymes. It also had problems keeping track of what I was trying to achieve and reverted to the original lyrics sometimes.

## Purpose

To collect new songs that the Linebreakers can perform at NDC and other conferences. I would welcome others to add songs that they have written as well.

I'll start with the first song that I wrote and have already sent to Dylan Beattie.

## Songs

* Zombie Code - Zombie by the Cranberries.
* Make It Dark - Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones.
* Behind Blue Screen - Behind Blue Eyes by Limp Bizkit.

### Ideas

This repo is open to any ideas for new songs.
