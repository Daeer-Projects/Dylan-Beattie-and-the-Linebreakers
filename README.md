# Dylan-Beattie-and-the-Linebreakers

A small repo with potential songs for the Linebreakers to use.

## Purpose

To collect new songs that the Linebreakers can perform at NDC and other conferences. I would welcome others to add songs that they have written as well.

I'll start with the first song that I wrote and have already sent to Dylan Beattie.

## Songs

* Zombie Code - Zombie by the Cranberries.

### Ideas

I'm looking at writing "Paint it Black" by the Rolling Stones as a song about making all app and website themes to be dark.

I want to write something based on "Behind Blue Eyes" by Limp Bizkit with something like "Nobody knows what its like to be the bad app, behind blue screen."
