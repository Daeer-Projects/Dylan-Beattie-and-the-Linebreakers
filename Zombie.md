# Zombie  Code Lyrics

## Original Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
Another head hangs lowly  
Child is slowly taken  
And the violence caused such silence  
Who are we mistaken?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family  
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'  
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns  
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'  
  
[Chorus]  
In your head, in your head  
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie  
What's in your head, in your head?  
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Du, du, du, du  
Du, du, du, du  
Du, du, du, du  
Du, du, du, du  
  
[Verse 2]  
Another mother's breakin'  
Heart is takin' over  
When the violence causes silence  
We must be mistaken  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It's the same old theme, since 1916  
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'  
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns  
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'  
  
[Chorus]  
In your head, in your head  
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie  
What's in your head, in your head?  
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, code-code-code-code-code-code-code, co-oh-de, ra-ra  

## Alternate Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
Another line of code  
App is slowly breaking  
And the errors cause such terror  
Who are we deluding?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But you see, it's not me, It's not my pull request  
In your code, in your code, they are hiding  
With their loops, and their ifs and their props, and their calls  
In your code, in your code, they are laughing  

[Chorus]  
In your code, in your code  
Zombie, zombie, zombie  
It's in your code, in your code  
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh  

[Post-Chorus]  
Du, du, du, du  
Du, du, du, du  
Du, du, du, du  
Du, du, du, du  

[Verse 2]  
Another project's breaking  
Work is taking over  
And the errors cause such terror  
We must be pretending  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It's the same old shit, since Windows ME  
In your code, in your code, they're still hiding  
With their loops, and their ifs and their props, and their calls  
In your code, in your code, they are breeding  

[Chorus]  
In your code, in your code  
Zombie, zombie, zombie  
It's in your code, in your code  
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, code-code-code-code-code-code-code, co-oh-de, ra-ra
