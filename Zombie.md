# Zombie  Code Lyrics

Another line of code  
App is slowly breaking  
And the errors cause such terror  
Who are we deluding?  

But you see, it's not me  
It's not my pull request  
In your code, in your code, they are hiding  
With their loops, and their ifs  
And their props, and their calls  
In your code, in your code, they are laughing  

In your code, in your code  
Zombie, zombie, zombie  
It's in your code, in your code  
Zombie, zombie, zombie  

Another project's breaking  
Work is taking over  
And the errors cause such terror  
We must be pretending  

It's the same old shit  
Since Windows ME  
In your code, in your code, they're still hiding  
With their loops, and their ifs  
And their props, and their calls  
In your code, in your code, they are breeding  

In your code, in your code  
Zombie, zombie, zombie  
It's in your code, in your code  
Zombie, zombie, zombie
